Just goofing around with CSS3
It's still a little messy

__A nod goes to:__
* [Jordan H](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2951820/jordan-h) for this [jsFiddle:](http://jsfiddle.net/33w67/4/)

I added this pulse CSS as I refactored from my much heavier original version (Jordan's pulse was _MUCH_ better than my attempt at that effect).
